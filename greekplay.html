    <h3>The Seven Plays in English Verse by Sophocles</h3>
    <p><em>Enter</em> CREON.</p>
    <h5>CR.</h5>
    <p>Citizens, hearing of dire calumny
        Denounced on me by Oedipus the King,
        I am here to make loud protest. If he think,
        In this embroilment of events, one word
        Or deed of mine hath wrought him injury,
        I am not careful to prolong my life
        Beneath such imputation. For it means
        No trifling danger, but disastrous harm,
        Making my life dishonoured in the state,
        And meanly thought of by my friends and you.</p>
        
    <h5>CH.</h5> 
    <p>Perchance 'twas but the sudden flash of wrath,
        Not the deliberate judgement of the soul.</p>
        
    <h5>CR.</h5> 
    <p>Who durst declare it[3], that Tir√©sias spake
        False prophecies, set on to this by me?</p>
        
    <h5>CH.</h5> 
    <p>Such things were said, I know not how advised.</p>
        
    <h5>CR.</h5>
    <p>And were the eyes and spirit not distraught,
        When the tongue uttered this to ruin me?</p>
        
    <h5>CH.</h5> 
    <p>I cannot say. To what my betters do
        I am blind. But see, the King comes forth again.</p>
        
    <p><em>Enter</em> OEDIPUS.</p> 
        
    <h5>OED.</h5>
    <p>Insolent, art thou here? Hadst thou the face
        To bring thy boldness near my palace-roof,
        Proved as thou art to have contrived my death
        And laid thy robber hands upon my state?
        Tell me, by heaven, had you seen in me
        A coward or a fool, when you planned this?--
        Deemed you I should be blind to your attempt
        Craftily creeping on, or, when perceived,
        Not ward it off? Is't not a silly scheme,
        To think to compass without troops of friends
        Power, that is only won by wealth and men?</p>
        
    <h5>CR.</h5> 
    <p>Wilt them be counselled? Hear as much in turn
        As thou hast spoken, and then thyself be judge.</p>
        
    <h5>OED.</h5> 
    <p>I know thy tongue, but I am slow to learn
        From thee, whom I have found my grievous foe.</p>
        
    <h5>CR.</h5>  
    <p>First on this very point, hear me declare--</p>
        
    <h5>OED.</h5> 
    <p>I will not hear that thou art not a villain.</p>
